Sports related CLI for FlatIron
    Doing Baseball Team, New York Yankees
    Going to use ESPN, much easier to scrape info than MLB (At least in my Opinion)

As a user I want to be able to:
    See the stats of the yankees in the current 2020 Post Season (Maybe regular season)
    Ability to choose between postion player or pitcher
    After what is chosen, then I can see the players in the specific catagory
        Will show me regular info, Name and Position
    As a user i want to be able to disect that player
        Will get an info on BA/ERA, HR Tally, Etc.

Going to give the user the option of exiting the program without seeing stats

    I may have bit off a bit more than i can chew, deciding on just showcasing
    the players info right from the jump. Maybe down the line i can make it more 
    advanced

    Tomorrow, or should i say later, i need to see how to get pithers to print
    actual pitchers instead of it running the first thing in self.current and that
    being "Aaron Judge".

    For submission sake, i might need to maybe only use info for one of two players
    per position. 

@3:25am
    yea... im bugging out. Just going to keep it simple maybe just Yankee star players
    hardcode their info in and then i can disect their info (maybe only like 4-5 ppl)

    Going to give user info on team leaders and their positions. then going to allow user
    to input what number they prefer more info on (1-5). My first option was too ambitious
    and very complex.. :(

    Only going to use info on average, HR's, and RBis for position players
    for pitchers i'll use ERA, GP, W/L

    I'll def changed the user method into an if, elseif statement. Its much cleaner than using
    case statements, yet i love using them lol
