# YankeesStats

Hi all!

This gem is giving the user the home run leader and the average leader in the MLB. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'Yankees_Stats'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install Yankees_Stats

## Usage

It starts off by asking you if you would like this info. You have the option of saying either yes or no. If you choose yes it'll display the HR and average leaders. If you choose no, it'll thank you for stopping by and exit the program. 

Once you've said yes, and the leaders are displayed, you proceed to choose which player you'd like more info on. You do so by typing either 1 or 2. Once the stats are loaded for that player, you then get option to see the other player stats or exit the program.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
